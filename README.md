# SoftwareEngineering
Project for Software Engineering

In the master branch, there is the project with all the artifacts of each sprint. Here you can see the entire commit history.
In the other branches there is a copy of the project of each release.

After downloading the entire folder or git cloning a branch, create a new project JavaFX with existing sources using "Project_SE_Gruppo04" as the project folder. Select the folder "src" as source packages and the folder "test" as test packages. JavaFX 8 must be used to start the application and the Hamcrest 1.3 and JUnit 4.13 libraries must be added to start the tests
